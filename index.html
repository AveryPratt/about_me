    <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p id="biography">Hi, I'm Avery. I was born January 7th, 1991. Before attending Code Fellows I was a novice self-taught programmer in .NET. I've been to Japan once when I was in 5th grade, and really want to travel more often but rarely get the chance. I have never flown in a hot air balloon. I used to own a pet snake, named Pretzel, but she got sick last year and died. Now I have no pets. I used to be good at math in middle school, but if you ask me how to calculate a symplectic integrator, I couldn't do to save my life.<br/><br/>

      It's nice to meet you!
