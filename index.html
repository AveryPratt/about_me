    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p id="biography">Hi, I'm Avery. Before attending Code Fellows I was a novice self-taught programmer in .NET.
      I've been to Japan once when I was in 5th grade, and really want to travel more often but rarely get the chance.
      I have never flown in a hot air balloon. I used to own a pet snake, named Pretzel, but got sick last year and died.
      Now I have no pets. I used to be good at math in middle school, but if you ask me how to calculate a symplectic
      integrator, I couldn't do to save my life.<br/><br/>It's nice to meet you!</p>
